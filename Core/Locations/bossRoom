The terrifying monster seems sleepy for now, you should hurry to the other side!
Once again, the exit closed behind you when you entered the room, the worst is yet to come since you can see a huge sleeping creature in the middle of the room. Moreover, it seems that there's enough space for you to sneak around to the other exit behind the creature.
