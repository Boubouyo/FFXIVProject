snakeStatue
The statue starts talking to you : "The Great Serpent of Ronko shall reveal the truth.". Maybe the engravings would be of any use. It holds an axe in it's mouth.
The statue seems pleased by your logic. It opens its mouth and frees the axe it was holding. 
A statue that seems pleased for some reasons. It looks like it is praying to some sort of snake engraving on the wall.
